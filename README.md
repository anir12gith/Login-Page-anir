# ðŸ’» About This Project

This project was built as part of my journey to learn and improve my web development skills.  
I'm a 16-year-old self-taught beginner programmer passionate about coding and technology.  
Each project I make helps me grow, learn new techniques, and turn ideas into reality.  
Thanks for checking it out!

Feel free to give feedback or suggestions ðŸ˜Š
